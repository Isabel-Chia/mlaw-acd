### <a id="Renewal of Registration"></a> Renewal of Registration

It is an <u>offence</u> if you act or hold out to be a regulated dealer without being registered or exempted. 

If you intend to continue your business as a regulated dealer and your registration period will be expiring in the next 3 months, you should renew your registration as soon as possible. It may take around 4 weeks for the Registrar to process an application for renewal before granting the renewal. It may take longer if additional information is required. If your renewal is not approved before the expiration of your registration, your registration will lapse and you will have to submit a new registration application.

Note: In your renewal application, your particulars will be auto-populated in the renewal application form. You should ensure that these are updated. The renewal process will take very little of your time if there are no changes to your registration information. Hence, we encourage you to submit your renewal application as soon as possible.

You may submit your application via the [GoBusiness Licensing Portal](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/licences). You may refer to the [GoBusiness Licensing Guide for Regulated Dealers](/images/GoBusiness%20Licensing%20Guide%20for%20Regulated%20Dealers_ACD_20191127.pdf) for a step-by-step guide to the application process.

The Registrar of Regulated Dealer may impose additional conditions or waive existing conditions for registration, for the renewed registration period.
