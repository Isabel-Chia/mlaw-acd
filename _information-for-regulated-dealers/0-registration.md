### Who is required to register?
You are required to register with the Registrar of Regulated Dealers if you are a regulated dealer i.e. you carry on a business of regulated dealing in precious stones, precious metals and/or precious products (**PSMs**), or as an intermediary for regulated dealing in PSMs. <br><br>
Examples of regulated dealers who are required to register include, but are not limited to jewellers, bullion traders, jewellery wholesalers, jewellery retailers, second-hand goods dealers, auction houses, and trading platforms.

Please refer to the [PSPM Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/7-2019/Published/20190313?DocDate=20190313) for the official definitions. If you are not certain whether you are required to register, you can seek legal advice.<br>

### Fees and period of registration
<b>Fees</b><br>
Regulated dealers must pay an application fee for each application to register with the Registrar. Regulated dealers who <b>submit their application by 31 May 2019 will enjoy a S$70 discount</b> off their application fee as an incentive for early registration.<br><br>
If the Registrar provides in-principle approval for their application, regulated dealers must pay a registration fee calculated based on the number of outlets they operate and the period for which they register

<b>Period of registration</b><br>
An applicant may apply for a specific class of registration that will determine the period of registration, i.e.:

<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, the Registrar has the discretion to grant a different class of registration than the class of registration applied for.
