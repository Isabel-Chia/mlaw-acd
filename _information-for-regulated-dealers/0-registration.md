### Who is required to register?
You are required to register with the Registrar of Regulated Dealers if you are a regulated dealer i.e. you carry on a business of regulated dealing in precious stones, precious metals and/or precious products (**PSMs**), or as an intermediary for regulated dealing in PSMs. <br><br>
Examples of regulated dealers who are required to register include, but are not limited to jewellers, bullion traders, jewellery wholesalers, jewellery retailers, second-hand goods dealers, auction houses, and trading platforms.

Please refer to the [PSPM Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp/7-2019/Published/20190313?DocDate=20190313) for the official definitions. If you are not certain whether you are required to register, you can seek legal advice.<br>
