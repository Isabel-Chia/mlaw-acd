**Note:**

* Registered dealers are regulated by the Registrar of Regulated Dealers for compliance with measures to prevent regulated dealing from being used to facilitate money laundering or terrorism financing.

* If you are a dealer existing before 10 April 2019, you have a transition period of 6 months up to i.e. 9 October 2019 to obtain your Certificate of Registration.

* If you have received the **In-Principle Approval** email notification, you are reminded to pay the registration fees by the stipulated payment due date. Please log in to [LicenceOne portal](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/web/frontier/home) to make your make of the registration fees.
