<p align="center"><b>Overview</b></p>

The Ministry of Law will put in place a new anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (“**AML/CFT**”) regulatory regime for precious stones and precious metals dealers (“**PSMDs**”) in Singapore. 

The PSMD sector is exposed to inherent money-laundering (“**ML**”) and terrorism financing (“**TF**”) risks, as precious stones and precious metals are good stores of value, easily transported and concealed, and easily convertible to cash. 

The new AML/CFT regime will strengthen existing measures against ML/TF risks by establishing a comprehensive supervisory and regulatory regime that is risk-focused and which addresses the specific ML/TF risks in the PSMD sector. 

The Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Bill (“**PSMD Bill**”) was passed by Parliament on 11 February 2019. The PSMD Bill is now being reviewed by the President and is expected to take effect in the second quarter of 2019.
