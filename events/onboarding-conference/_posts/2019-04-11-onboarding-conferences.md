At these conferences, ACD will give an overview of the regulatory requirements introduced by the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act 2019 (the "**PSPM Act**"). ACD will also provide guidance on the registration process for regulated dealers.
