The Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Division ("**ACD**") of the Ministry of Law will be organising an induction briefing for the registered dealers in the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers sector in the upcoming months. Each registered dealer may send up to 2 representatives.

The aim of the briefing is to provide an overview of the Precious Stones and Precious Metals ("PSPM") Act 2019.

An invitation email from ACD will be sent to registered dealers. Successful registrants will recieve a confirmation email with more details on the briefing.

We hope to see you there!
