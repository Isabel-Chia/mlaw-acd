Pursuant to regulation 7(2)(a)(ii) of the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Regulations (“**PMLTF Regulations**”), the Registrar of Regulated Dealers hereby notifies all regulated dealers that the Financial Action Task Force (“**FATF**”) has issued a Public Statement dated June 2019, in which it has called for:
* Counter-measures against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (“**DPRK**”).
* Enhanced customer due diligence measures against Iran.

Accordingly, under regulation 7(1) of the PMLTF Regulations, regulated dealers must perform enhanced customer due diligence measures if:
* The customer, or the person on whose behalf the customer is acting, is from or in DPRK or Iran; or
* The transaction relates to DPRK or Iran.

On 21 June 2019, the FATF, of which Singapore is a member, issued an updated Public Statement that highlights the strategic deficiencies in the anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes of the DPRK and Iran.
* DPRK is subject to the FATF’s call on countries to apply counter-measures. The FATF calls on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply counter-measures to protect the international financial system from the ongoing and substantial money laundering and financing of terrorism risks.
* The FATF calls on its members and urges all jurisdictions to apply enhanced customer due diligence measures proportionate to the risks arising from Iran.
