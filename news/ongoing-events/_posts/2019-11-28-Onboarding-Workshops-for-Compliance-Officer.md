The Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Division ("**ACD**") of the Ministry of Law will be organising Onboarding Workshops for the registered dealers in the Precious Stones and Precious Metals Dealers sector in the upcoming months. 

The Onboarding Workshop aims to enable the compliance officer of registered dealers to:

(a) Perform an assessment of the money laundering ("**ML**") and terrorism financing ("**TF**") risks faced by their business; and

(b) Develop internal policies, procedures and controls ("**IPPC**") to manage and effectively mitigate the ML/TF risks.

An invitation email from ACD will be sent to registered dealers to sign up for the onboarding workshop. Registered dealers may also click [here](htttps://go.gov.sg/onboardingworkshop){:target="_blank"} to sign up for the workshop.
